Since four years ago, when I made my first web page and put it up on kabirgoel.com, this website has served as a testing ground for my design skills. This redesign marks (I think) the 12th or 13th iteration.

But in changing the design so frequently, I forgot to use this website to showcase myself and my abilities. So this iteration is all about content: a place for my writing, my projects, and my design work. I’ll add more sections to the website as I get time to implement them.

That’s also why I built this blog. I’ve wanted a place to talk about code, design, and other things that interest me for a while, and I’m not entirely comfortable with trusting [Medium](https://medium.com) with my canonical writing. (The issues with Medium are [well documented](https://www.cdevn.com/why-medium-actually-sucks/).) I’m hoping to use it as a place where I can write, make mistakes and learn along the way.

(In case you’re wondering: this website is written in [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), an awesome React static-site-generator, and uses the IBM Plex font family for text.)
