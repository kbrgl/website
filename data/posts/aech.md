_This is part one of a series of blog posts where I talk about the work that went into building Rucksack, a new newsletter platform that I'm working on._

While working on Rucksack, I converged on a set of CSS styles that look great, are easy to apply consistently, and are fairly compact. I've since used them in a couple of other projects. Rather than copy-paste these styles from one project to another, though, I decided to spin them off into their own little module. It’s called Aech (named after a character from Ready Player One, a book I’m currently reading). Aech is inspired by [paper.css](https://github.com/thesephist/paper.css).

Take a look at the [Aech homepage](https://kbrgl.github.io/aech) or browse the source code over on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbrgl/aech).
